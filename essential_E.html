                    <li>
                      Essential oils are highly concentrated extracts of herbs. Its application of originally derived
                      from Europe, which is similar to the spirit of the traditional Chinese herbs principles. 
                    </li>
                    <li> Both of them are conditioning with physical or mental based on characteristics of plants. The
                      main difference is the adsorb methods in different way, Chinese herb is using edible way to
                      absorb, and essential oil is using infiltrated by human skin or respiratory system to absorb in a
                      more detailed and fundamental way for body and mind. The advantages of 100% natural essential oils
                      is that it can make a direct application for the physical or spiritual level from specific
                      individual needs.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Essential oils are plant-specific extraction of aromatic substances, taken from the herb flowers,
                      leaves, roots, bark, fruits, seeds, resin, and refining by the way of distillation and squeezing
                      methods.

                    <li>
                      Venus provides natural essential oils derived from the foreign suppliers of advanced equipment and
                      a long history of expertise. More importantly, the suppliers are highly focus on the raw material
                      source and origin of the selection with multiple considerations, including the factors soil,
                      temperature, humidity, latitude, altitude, etc., in order to obtain the best quality essential
                      oils. That is why essential oil is difficult to be replaced by other substances.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Another reason why oil is called "Liquid Gold" lies in its rare, according to its manufacturing
                      process is very cumbersome and difficult to obtain its raw materials, so that can not be mass
                      production at once. Plants are also suitable for planting in the area, the same plants in
                      different regions or different climate will cause essential oils different. Also, for refining
                      essential oil requires a lot of plants, 200 kilograms of lavender only can extract 1 kg of
                      essential oil, in another words, 2-4 tonnes of refined rose only can extract 1 kg of essential
                      oil.
                    </li>
                    <li>Due to the high volatility and small molecule of essential oils, it is easily absorbed by the
                      body and be penetrated into the human body organs quickly. And the extra water will get rid of the
                      body with excess ingredients, the whole process only takes a few minutes. Moreover, the aroma of
                      the plant itself will directly stimulates the pituitary gland secretion, enzyme and hormone
                      secretion, and balance the body function, also in a role of skin care.</li>
                    <li>The most importantly, essential oils can ease the way to a gradual adjustment and strengthen the
                      immune system, and thus promote harmony of body and soul. You can imagine how essential oils on
                      the mysteries of the human body is extremely broad.</li>
